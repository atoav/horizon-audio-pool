# horizon-audio-pool

This is a parts library/pool for [Horizon-EDA](https://horizon-eda.org/) focused on all things audio, synthesizer and guitar-electronics. All parts that are to odd for a [Pull Request in the official pool](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/pulls) or useful parts that have not been accepted yet land in this pool.

This pool includes the main one, so feel free to download it and either include it in your own pool, or just use it.
